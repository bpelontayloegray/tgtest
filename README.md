# tgtest
	Just want to test a few basic concepts and not waste your time in the process.  This should take less than 20 minutes.

	1) If you're this far you clearly understand git, so you're off to a good start.

	2) Add a content block and style it like the picture examples, (it's near the footer - notated in the graphic) this will demonstarate understanding of bootsrap html markup and basic css.  

	3) Add a vertially centered bootstrap modal that pops up saying "give me the job already." 2 seconds after the dom loads. [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/] 
		This will demonstarate basic jquery/javascript understanding and how to read documentation.


	I've already linked up the test css files. You can just add the js inline on this page.


	Once complete, just push back up to the repo.
